# Codex Prompt: TSN HTML Pitch Deck

You are working on the standalone TSN HTML pitch deck repository.

## Project

- Repository: `https://github.com/Trustlink-Labs/TSN-Pitch-Deck`
- Local project folder: `pitch-deck/`
- Public website: `https://trustlink-labs.github.io/TSN-Pitch-Deck/`
- Default branch: `main`
- Deployment: GitHub Pages through GitHub Actions
- This is a static website. Do not introduce React, Vite, Node build tooling, or a server unless explicitly requested.

## Repository Boundary

This folder is a nested, standalone Git repository inside the larger TSN source project.

- The Git root for this deck is `pitch-deck/`, not the parent TSN project.
- Do not initialize Git at the parent project root.
- Do not copy or commit the parent TSN codebase into this repository.
- Do not modify unrelated files in the parent project.
- The standalone remote is `https://github.com/Trustlink-Labs/TSN-Pitch-Deck.git`.

## Files

### `index.html`

This is the entire pitch-deck application and the GitHub Pages entry point. It is a self-contained HTML document containing:

- Inline CSS and responsive layout rules
- Inline JavaScript for slide navigation and animations
- Inline SVG TSN network marks
- Inline SVG noise texture
- Google Fonts loaded externally: Fraunces, IBM Plex Mono, and Archivo
- No local asset files are currently required

Preserve the existing visual language and content unless the user explicitly requests a design or copy change. Avoid unnecessary rewrites or formatting churn.

The deck currently has 15 slides:

1. Cover
2. The problem
3. The offer
4. How it works
5. Cross-chain settlement
6. Live demo
7. Cross-chain protocol / Attestcoin
8. Architecture
9. Market
10. Business
11. Traction
12. Growth
13. Roadmap
14. Team
15. Closing

The slide system uses `.slide` sections and JavaScript toggling of the `.active` class. The navigation controls are:

- `#prevBtn`
- `#nextBtn`
- `#dots`
- Keyboard: Arrow Left, Arrow Up, Arrow Right, Arrow Down, and Space

The top-left header contains an inline SVG network logo beside the `TSN` text. Keep this logo self-contained. Do not replace it with an unnecessary external image dependency.

Interactive behaviors include:

- Slide transitions and reveal animations
- Dot navigation
- Keyboard navigation
- Animated ticker tape
- Typed TIN demo on slide 6
- Counter animation on the traction slide
- Reduced-motion support through `prefers-reduced-motion`

## GitHub Pages Workflow

### `.github/workflows/pages.yml`

This workflow deploys the repository root as a static Pages artifact whenever `main` receives a push. It also supports manual dispatch.

Important steps:

1. Checkout the repository.
2. Configure GitHub Pages.
3. Upload the repository root with `actions/upload-pages-artifact`.
4. Deploy with `actions/deploy-pages`.

Do not remove the checkout step. Without it, the artifact will not contain `index.html` and the public site will return a GitHub Pages 404.

## Package Helper

### `package.json`

There are no runtime dependencies. The only helper is:

```bash
npm run push
```

It runs:

```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Update pitch deck" && git push origin main
```

Use it only from inside `pitch-deck/`. It stages all changes in the standalone deck repository, commits them, and pushes `main`, which triggers GitHub Pages deployment.

## Safe Editing Rules

- Keep the deck as a simple static `index.html` site.
- Preserve the slide order, navigation, animations, responsive behavior, and typography.
- Keep all assets inline when practical.
- Check that relative paths work from `/TSN-Pitch-Deck/`; do not assume the site is hosted at `/`.
- Avoid absolute local filesystem paths.
- Avoid adding a build system for a simple HTML change.
- Use ASCII for new source text unless the deck already requires a specific Unicode character.
- Do not change the parent TSN repository history or remotes.
- Before committing, inspect `git status` and `git diff` from `pitch-deck/`.
- Do not claim deployment success until the Pages workflow succeeds and the public URL loads.

## Validation Checklist

After editing:

1. Confirm `pitch-deck/index.html` exists.
2. Parse the inline JavaScript with Node, for example by extracting the script and running `node --check`.
3. Check for missing local `src` or `href` references.
4. Serve locally with:

   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8765
   ```

5. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/` and verify:
   - The first slide renders.
   - The next and previous buttons work.
   - Dot navigation works.
   - Keyboard navigation works.
   - The live demo and counter animations work.
   - The layout remains usable on mobile widths.
   - The browser console has no JavaScript errors.
6. Run `npm run push` from `pitch-deck/`.
7. Check the GitHub Actions Pages workflow.
8. Verify `https://trustlink-labs.github.io/TSN-Pitch-Deck/` returns HTTP 200 and renders the deck.

## Expected Response After Changes

Report briefly:

- What changed in `index.html` or supporting files
- Validation performed
- Commit and deployment status
- Public URL

Remember: this is a presentation deck, not a general TSN application. Make the smallest focused change that satisfies the request.
