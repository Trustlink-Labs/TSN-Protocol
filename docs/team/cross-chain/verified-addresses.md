# Verified cross-chain addresses

## Purpose and status

This is the team evidence register for public contract addresses, token
addresses, and network identifiers used by TSN. An entry is marked **verified**
only when it was checked on the target network or is supported by a mined
deployment record linked to the target explorer.

**Observed on:** 2026-09-12  
**Scope:** Solana Devnet and Creditcoin CC3 Testnet  
**Important:** Base, Ethereum, and other EVM destinations have no verified
TSN-owned deployment in this register yet. They must not be presented as live
routes.

## Network identifiers

| Network | Role | Identifier | Explorer |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Solana Devnet | Source accounting and native settlement | `devnet` | [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/?cluster=devnet) |
| Creditcoin CC3 Testnet | First EVM destination and settlement domain | EVM chain ID `102031` | [Blockscout](https://creditcoin-testnet.blockscout.com/) · [Subscan](https://creditcoin3-testnet.subscan.io/) |

Creditcoin EVM contracts are checked through Blockscout/RPC. Subscan shows
Creditcoin runtime activity and is not a Solana transaction explorer.

## Solana Devnet

| SPL Token Program | `TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA` | [Solana Explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/address/TokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DA?cluster=devnet) | Canonical program |

The repository contains a TCAP address reference, but that string did not pass
the live Solana account check in this inventory. It is intentionally not listed
as verified until the exact Devnet program ID is confirmed.

## Creditcoin tokens

| Asset | Address | Evidence | Settlement status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CTC | Native asset; no ERC-20 contract address | [CC3 Blockscout](https://creditcoin-testnet.blockscout.com/) | Gas only; not payout liquidity |

| USDC-Test | [`0xbB24c8DaC3cBe2021F3E3823724CE19f08B81135`](https://creditcoin-testnet.blockscout.com/address/0xbB24c8DaC3cBe2021F3E3823724CE19f08B81135) | CC3 Blockscout token index: `USDC-Test`, symbol `USDC-T`, 6 decimals | Test token only; deployer and direct vault balances were `0` |

`USDC-T` and `USDT-T` are the usable CC3 testnet candidates found in the
explorer. Their names do not establish Circle or Tether issuance. They must be
described as Creditcoin test assets, not as official USDC or USDT.

The live registry stores the exact payout token address. A USDC route pays
only the registered USDC contract and a USDT route pays only the registered
USDT contract. The direct lane has no swap, router, or symbol substitution.

## Other EVM networks

| Network | TSN-owned contracts | TSN-approved payout tokens | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ethereum | None verified | None verified | Not an active TSN route |
| Base | None verified | None verified | Not an active TSN route |
| Other EVM networks | None verified | None verified | Adapter and liquidity evidence required |

## Verification procedure

For every new entry, record the network, chain ID, address, deployment or
configuration transaction, explorer link, bytecode/account-owner check, token
metadata, and current liquidity observation. The current CC3 check used
`eth_getCode` against `https://rpc.cc3-testnet.creditcoin.network`; every
listed CC3 contract returned non-empty bytecode. The Solana check used
`solana account ... --url devnet`; the listed TSN and TIN accounts returned
executable BPF accounts, and the listed mint returned the canonical SPL Token
Program owner.

When an address is not verified, leave it out of active route configuration.
Do not fill the gap with a placeholder, guessed address, or token from another
network.

## Next evidence gate

The next valid update is a selected `USDC-T` or `USDT-T` route, a prefunded
route vault, a successful `observeLocalLiquidity` call, and the resulting
registry state. Until those artifacts exist, the direct Creditcoin lane is
deployed infrastructure with zero payout liquidity, not a completed stablecoin
settlement demonstration.
