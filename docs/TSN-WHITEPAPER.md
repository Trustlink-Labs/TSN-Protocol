# Transfer Settlement Network (TSN)

## A protocol for identity-aware settlement and private balance accounting

### Abstract

The Transfer Settlement Network (TSN) is an intent-based protocol for stablecoin settlement. It separates payment identity, authorization, routing, settlement liability, and private accounting so that an automated submitter can execute an authorized payment without custody of the owner's keys or disclosure of the recipient's balance.

The current source accounting domain is Solana. The repository also contains the Creditcoin-first EVM settlement boundary, Attestcoin route verification, destination vault/executor contracts, and deployment helpers. These source components are not the same as a live production deployment: testnet deployment and real transaction evidence are required before claiming the cross-chain path is operational.

## 1. Protocol model

A payment is a state transition authorized by the sender, not an instruction assembled by a relay. The owner device resolves a recipient TIN, binds the privacy-receiving relationship and policy, and signs an intent containing the asset, amount, validity window, replay material, and settlement commitments. Every later transition is bound to those signed values.

The intended privacy-safe route is:

```text
TIN → privacy-receiving root → GPRU → TSN Epoch Treasury
    → AcceptedIntent → ConfidentialSettlement → TCAP tip credit
    → encrypted private balance snapshot → owner private read
```

TIN is a payment identity. GPRU is scoped, non-custodial authorization and
routing; it never holds a balance. TSN coordinates settlement liability and
Cranker reimbursement. TCAP (Transfer Confidential Asset Protocol) holds
governed custody and records opaque private balance transitions. The legacy
AcceptedIntent and per-transfer receipt path is not used for new transfers.

## 2. Participants and authority

The owner device holds the privacy-receiving root, signing material and snapshot key. The Receiver accepts authenticated, redacted work. The Node verifies signatures, policy, commitments, sequence and expiry. Mother and TSN authorize the ConfidentialSettlement transition. The Epoch Treasury records funded liability. A Cranker submits the exact authorized transaction and pays execution fees; it cannot alter the amount, asset, recipient, commitments, policy, sequence or nullifier. TCAP verifies the receipt and advances the recipient tip.

No coordination role grants a spending key or unilateral authority to redirect value.

## 2A. Community route governance

TSN treats network expansion as a settlement-infrastructure decision, not as a
simple chain-list update. A proposed destination changes the asset contract,
executor, liquidity source, finality assumptions, gas model, message route,
monitoring requirements, and failure recovery procedure. The community can
propose, review, and vote on those changes through an evidence-based route
admission process.

The intended lifecycle is:

```text
route proposal
    → deployment and liquidity evidence
    → technical and security review
    → public discussion and vote
    → timelocked registry activation
    → Node live-liquidity gate
    → authorized settlement
```

Community approval does not create value, override a sender-signed intent,
replace Attestcoin proof verification, or give a Cranker payout authority. The
Node still validates the route and exact authorization, the Cranker submits
only the leased transaction, and the destination vault remains the source of
stablecoin liquidity. Verified source and settlement signatures identify who
submitted a proposal or vote; they do not by themselves prove that a contract,
token, or liquidity provider is safe.

Before the on-chain registry is deployed, the team must define quorum, voter
eligibility, duplicate-vote prevention, sybil resistance, proposal expiry,
timelocks, emergency pause, conflict disclosure, and route retirement. The
current repository documents this governance design but does not claim that a
community registry or live route vote is deployed.

## Immutable On-Chain Destination Registry (Community-Governed)

`DestinationRegistry.sol` is the proposed append-only admission layer for
future settlement routes. It does not replace
`DestinationLiquidityRegistry.sol`: the governance registry records a route
proposal and its community decision, while the operational registry records
proof-backed liquidity observations and reservations used by the Creditcoin
Settlement Hub.

A route proposal binds a destination chain, destination network, executor,
stablecoin, and a digest of the Solana evidence validated by the TSN Node. A
configured Creditcoin route attestor signs the complete proposal using EIP-712.
Community voters can vote once per route; quorum and a timelock are required
before activation. An emergency guardian can deactivate a route without being
able to rewrite its immutable route fields.

The registry is a governance control, not a liquidity source or a payout
contract. The Attestcoin ASC continues to verify destination liquidity, the
Creditcoin Hub consumes the authorized commitment and publishes the
authenticated message, and the destination executor releases stablecoins from
its prefunded vault. The Node verifies the original Solana signature and
commitment before producing the evidence digest; the registry does not claim
that Solidity natively verifies a Solana signature.

This contract and governance design are included as integration code and
technical documentation. `DestinationRegistry` is deployed on CC3 Testnet at
[`0xd8DD919B3Cf8C365Bb0dc82Dd3D06Cf5B8f41ba0`](https://creditcoin-testnet.blockscout.com/address/0xd8DD919B3Cf8C365Bb0dc82Dd3D06Cf5B8f41ba0)
under transaction
[`0xe34fd69dc1e8b39e308e13493918b8238a5a69f9bc327d7ea57daeaef659bf52`](https://creditcoin-testnet.blockscout.com/tx/0xe34fd69dc1e8b39e308e13493918b8238a5a69f9bc327d7ea57daeaef659bf52).
The registry is therefore live as code, but no route is live until proposal,
voting, activation, liquidity, and payout receipts are observed.

## 3A. Payment routes

TSN supports four native Solana routes and one Creditcoin-led cross-chain route:

| Route | Settlement behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Wallet deposit → wallet exit | Compatibility route using common intent, authorization, and liability boundaries. |
| Wallet deposit → TIN credit | Funds become private TCAP credit for the recipient identity. |
| TIN debit → TIN credit | Identity-to-identity settlement without exposing a public destination address from the device boundary. |
| TIN debit → wallet exit | Public wallet exit through the existing Mother-rooted DNA and exit-permit boundary. |
| Solana → Creditcoin or another supported EVM network | Solana creates the debit commitment; Creditcoin consumes it and Attestcoin connects the authenticated instruction to a selected prefunded destination route. |

The cross-chain route extends the settlement boundary; it does not replace the native Solana paths.

## 3. Solana settlement domain

The current domain executes these transitions:

1. The device resolves the recipient TIN and signs the canonical payment intent.
2. The Receiver stores authenticated redacted work; the Node verifies it.
3. A Cranker submits the exact governed Solana funding and acceptance transaction.
4. TSN verifies the accounts and records the aggregate liability.
5. The Node activates settlement only after funding and route checks pass.
6. Mother/TSN authorizes the applicable settlement transition.
7. The Cranker submits the exact authorized Solana credit or exit transaction.
8. TCAP checks the receipt, commitments, sequence, policy, scope, validity window, and nullifier.
9. The owner device verifies and decrypts the encrypted snapshot addressed by the resulting commitment.

The legacy `AcceptedIntentV1` and `ConfidentialSettlement` receipt path is not
the privacy-safe V2 path. It remains in source only for migration and audit
history and must not be used for new transfers.

## 4. State and commitments

The legacy V1 `AcceptedIntent` bound the epoch, payment commitment, amount,
token, recipient tip root, policy, settlement commitments, replay nonce and
validity window. That public cross-reference is not part of the privacy-safe
V2 authorization; V2 binds only the opaque GPRU tip transition and its
predecessor/sequence continuity.

A TCAP tip stores a predecessor commitment and sequence, not a plaintext TIN, private balance or device secret. A credit advances one predecessor to one successor:

```text
previous_commitment = tip.current_commitment
new_commitment      = successor(previous_commitment, authorized transition)
new_sequence        = tip.sequence + 1
```

The snapshot store holds encrypted balance state keyed by the resulting commitment. Plaintext roots, seeds, snapshot keys and balances remain with the owner device.

## 5. Security invariants

The protocol requires device authorization over canonical fields, one-time nullifiers, monotonic sequences, validity windows, exact policy and GPRU scope, and predecessor/successor commitment continuity. Treasury funding and intent acceptance are atomic. Receiver, Node and Cranker may be unavailable, but they cannot rewrite an accepted authorization or spend from it. Confidential debit and exit are proof-gated until conservation, destination-binding and liquidity proofs are enabled.

Public state exposes only evidence required for verification: commitments, token identifiers, policy references, sequence values, nullifiers and validity data. TIN is bound to the receiving root through a one-way relationship and is not a public key for a TCAP balance.

## 6. Settlement domains and attestations

A settlement domain is a blockchain-specific execution environment with its own assets, finality and transaction rules. TSN keeps identity and intent semantics stable while a domain adapter maps a verified authorization into that environment.

Attestation is TSN's cross-domain connection mechanism. An attestation binds source and destination domains, settlement identifier, assets, amount, accepted intent, recipient, sequence or nonce, validity window and the settlement commitment. The destination verifies the cryptographic source fact before executing its own transaction. A transaction hash, API response or operator statement is not sufficient.

## 7. Creditcoin-first EVM domain

The first additional settlement domain is Creditcoin. The source repository contains the Creditcoin route, liquidity, executor, and message boundaries, but deployment and real testnet evidence are still required before calling the path live:

```text
Solana debit intent
    → Node validation and destination liquidity preflight
    → Solana debit commitment
    → Creditcoin Hub authorization
    → Attestcoin authenticated message
    → Creditcoin or selected EVM executor
    → prefunded stablecoin vault → recipient
```

The destination must reject a message whose domain, asset, amount, recipient, settlement identifier, finality, route, or validity window does not match the source authorization. This adapter does not replace TSN authorization or TCAP accounting. Creditcoin is the first funded EVM settlement domain and the source for onward supported-EVM payout messages.

## 8. Liquidity and value model

A message is not a payment asset. The value path is:

    Liquidity provider or treasury
        → prefunded stablecoin vault on the payout network
        → registered destination executor
        → recipient wallet

Creditcoin CTC pays Creditcoin gas. The destination network's native token pays destination gas. Stablecoins are the payout asset. Attestcoin proof and message infrastructure verifies and connects a route; it does not create liquidity. A route is not eligible without a configured executor, token, destination network, and current liquidity observation.

The direct Creditcoin route and an onward Base/Ethereum-style route use the same principle: the network that pays the recipient must have the stablecoin available in its own configured vault. The Hub reserves verified route capacity before publishing the payout message.

## 9. Contract and software boundaries

| Component | Responsibility | Value custody |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CreditcoinSettlementHub.sol | Verify authorization, reject replay, reserve route capacity, publish payout message | No destination payout balance |
| DestinationLiquidityASC.sol | Verify source liquidity evidence through Attestcoin readability | None |
| DestinationLiquidityRegistry.sol | Store route configuration, observations, and reservations | None |
| TSNSettlementExecutor.sol | Validate authenticated destination message and invoke local payout | Uses vault boundary |
| TSNERCLiquidityVault.sol | Hold and release destination stablecoins | Yes, destination liquidity |
| TinExitAttestedASC.sol | Record a proved exit receipt | No payout liquidity |
| TSN Node | Orchestrate, validate, authorize, and track | No user payout custody |
| Cranker | Submit exact authorized transactions and pay gas | No user payout custody |

Solana-native programs remain outside the cross-chain layer. The cross-chain layer must not rewrite sealed TIP, the two-phase exit commitment, Path 1/2 wiring, one-vault behavior, liability PDAs, or GPRU-only authorization.

## 10. Threat model

Security depends on source and destination consensus, cryptographic signatures, attestation verification, TSN authorization rules and the correctness of each domain adapter. Liveness depends on Receiver, Node, Cranker and destination liquidity. A failure may delay or revert a transition; it must not create value, bypass a nullifier, or redirect an authorized payment.

The threat model includes compromised or unavailable Receiver, Node, Cranker, relayer, liquidity provider, source RPC, and destination RPC. Availability failure may delay settlement; it must not authorize a new value transfer, bypass a nullifier, redirect a recipient, or convert an invalid message into a payout.

The current Creditcoin Hub authorization proves a Node-signed commitment payload on Creditcoin. It does not claim that Creditcoin independently verifies a Solana transaction through Block Prover. Solana source facts remain validated by the Node and existing Solana program boundaries until a supported cryptographic source-proof path is deployed.

No raw TIN, private balance, device key, plaintext receiving root, or snapshot secret is written to Creditcoin or another secondary EVM network.

ZK-PRU was an earlier experiment and is retired. It is not part of the receiving, balance or spending architecture described here.

## 11. Implementation and deployment status

The repository contains the cross-chain contracts, Node route validation, TSN-only SDK façade, Attestcoin integration helpers, and testnet deployment scripts. Source compilation is not the same as a live deployment.

Before claiming the happy path is live, the team must:

1. configure a funded Creditcoin CC3 Testnet EVM signer;
2. provide the real CC3 Attestcoin token and protocol route addresses;
3. deploy the Creditcoin contracts on CC3 Testnet;
4. configure a supported destination route and prefund its stablecoin vault;
5. submit a real Solana debit transaction;
6. submit the resulting authorized Creditcoin settlement transaction; and
7. record real explorer links and emitted events.

No contract address, liquidity balance, receipt event, or transaction hash should be published until it is observed on the relevant testnet explorer.

## 12. Scope and non-goals

This paper covers identity-aware settlement coordination, Solana source accounting, Creditcoin-first EVM settlement, Attestcoin liquidity verification and message delivery, destination stablecoin liquidity, and the Node/Cranker execution boundary.

It does not claim that a proof or message is itself a stablecoin, that Creditcoin pays every destination from one universal vault, that Solana is currently supported by Creditcoin's native Block Prover, that a Cranker generates proofs or makes payout decisions, or that source-chain verification is live before testnet deployment evidence exists.
